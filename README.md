[RestrucuringAI is currently in progress - Version 0.0.1]

This is a datascraping tool which withdraws restructuring information from SEC 10-K reports, using both the SEC and OpenAI APIs. 
Company data scraped so far is stored in csv format in the 'company_csv' folder.


This project was created for my Berkeley Haas Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship (URAP) with Professors Anastassia Fedyk, Tatiana Fedyk, and Natalya Khimich.
